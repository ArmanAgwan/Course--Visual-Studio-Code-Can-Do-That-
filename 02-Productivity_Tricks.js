//                   //----------Essential navigation shortcuts----------//

// VS Code has a keyboard shortcut for virtually anything that you can do with a mouse. 
// The more of these that you can use, the faster you will be. In addition to the 5 core keyboard shortcuts from the start of this workshop, 
// these are the essential keyboard shortcuts for navigating around the editor without a mouse.

//              //----------Creating HTML with Emmet----------//


// Web developers spend a lot of their time composing HTML. There is a feature built-in to VS Code called "Emmet".
// Emmet helps you to quickly create markup, styles and even provides some neat utilities for automating various routine tasks.


// :-Create HTML boilerplate:-

// 1- Open the "index.html" file in the "start" folder

// 2- Scaffold out a base HTML file

//    1- Type ! and press tab

// 3- Press tab 3 more times to place the cursor at the tab stop in the "title" attribute and entire "I Love Lamp"

// 4- Press tab once more to enter the body of the page


//               //-----Include the Bulma CSS framework-----//


// Bulma is a great little CSS framework. We're going to use it to help us position all of
// the elements on the page.

// 1- In the head tag of the page, type link and press tab

// 2- Enter "bulma.css". Bulma is included as a local file in the "start" project


//               //----------Add some markup----------//


// You'll see two sections of markup that are commented out - Step 1 and Step 2. You'll need to create these 
// blocks with Emmet.

// 1- Enter .has-text-centered and press tab and then enter

// 2- Enter img and press tab

// 3- Enter "logo.png" as the "src" of the image

// 4- Add a new line after the closing </div> tag

// Type .section>.columns and press tab
